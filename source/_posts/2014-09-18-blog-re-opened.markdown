After a few years in the dark, my blog has just been re-opened. It has been so long since my last blog entry that my life has took a turn to a very different yet exciting new path.

I am currently working at Google, as an SRE and most my daily basis work involves system troubleshooting. On the other hand, I've fallen in love with Go and it's where I spend most of my free time.

I'll be blogging a lot about systems and system administration, but I will also share everything that I know and will know about Go, so stay tuned!
